##### OSM GPS USING PYTHON3

### Problem description :

*	A map for this system should be obtained from www.openstreetmap.org. Select the city and press the "Export" button to get the map in osm format.
*	You can understand how to use the openstreetmaps page by reading the following: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Browsing.
*	You will have to calculate the distance between vertices through latitude and longitude. Here's how to do this at: http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html.
*	You can use a program ready to extract from the osm the vertices with their latitude and longitude. This program is written in python and uses NetworkX.
*	You should write a text that explains how to use your program (readme.txt)
* 	The navigation system should receive a map in the format osm and two vertices (origin and destination) of the map; and you should return the map drawing with the shortest path drawing from the source to the destination.
